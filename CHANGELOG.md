## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

**Search and Person Pages - Complete NR Content Filtering**
- **Issue:** NR (Not Rated) content still appearing in search results and person pages despite rating restrictions
- **Root Cause:** While person endpoints used `createTmdbWithRegionLanguage(req.user)`, the combined_credits endpoint didn't apply certification-based filtering to the actual credits
- **Fix:** 
  - Added `filterCreditsByRating` helper function to `server/routes/person.ts`
  - Person combined_credits now separates cast/crew by media_type and applies certification filtering before display
  - Simplified search filtering logic for consistency
- **Result:** NR content is now properly excluded from both search results and person pages based on user rating restrictions

## [1.5.7] - 2025-10-11 (LATEST RELEASE)

### 🎯 **Fix Issue #16 - Content Filtering Gaps**

#### 🐛 Issues Fixed

**1. Person Pages - Content Rating Filters Not Applied**
- **Issue:** Clicking on actors/persons showed unfiltered content regardless of user rating restrictions
- **Root Cause:** `server/routes/person.ts` used `new TheMovieDb()` without user context
- **Fix:** Changed to use `createTmdbWithRegionLanguage(req.user)` to pass user's rating settings
- **Result:** Person pages now respect maxMovieRating and maxTvRating restrictions

**2. Collection Pages - Content Rating Filters Not Applied**
- **Issue:** Movie collections displayed content exceeding user's rating limits
- **Root Cause:** `server/routes/collection.ts` used `new TheMovieDb()` without user context
- **Fix:** Changed to use `createTmdbWithRegionLanguage(req.user)` to apply certification filtering
- **Result:** Collection pages now properly filter based on user settings

**3. Trending/Series Pages - TV Rating Filtering Broken**
- **Issue:** Users with TV-PG max rating were seeing TV-14 shows (Desperate Housewives, Big Bang Theory)
- **Root Cause:** Backend only had movie-style rating mappings (G, PG, R) but UI sends TV-style ratings (TV-PG, TV-14)
- **Symptom:** When user set TV-PG, it didn't match any mapping, fell through to exact-match only, filtering failed
- **Fix:** Added complete TV-style rating mappings to `tvRatingMapping` in `server/api/themoviedb/index.ts`:
  - TV-Y: ['TV-Y']
  - TV-Y7: ['TV-Y', 'TV-Y7']
  - TV-G: ['TV-Y', 'TV-Y7', 'TV-G']
  - TV-PG: ['TV-Y', 'TV-Y7', 'TV-G', 'TV-PG']
  - TV-14: ['TV-Y', 'TV-Y7', 'TV-G', 'TV-PG', 'TV-14']
  - TV-MA: ['TV-Y', 'TV-Y7', 'TV-G', 'TV-PG', 'TV-14', 'TV-MA']
- **Result:** TV certification filtering now works correctly for Trending and Series discovery

**4. Network Browsing - Curated Filters Applied Incorrectly**
- **Issue:** Unrestricted users (TV-MA, Block XXX Adult) saw very limited content on networks
- **Example:** Kids genre showed 2 results, Netflix showed minimal catalog
- **Root Cause:** v1.5.6 over-filtered by applying curated filters to all users
- **Fix:** Made `skipCuratedFilters` conditional based on user's curated filter settings:
  - If both curatedMinVotes and curatedMinRating are 0 or undefined → skip curated filters
  - If either value is set → apply curated filters
- **Result:** Unrestricted users see full catalogs, users with quality filters see filtered content

#### ✨ Additional Improvements

**Curated Filter 0 Values**
- Setting minimum votes/rating to 0 now properly disables those filters
- Changed discover.ts defaults from `?? 3000` and `?? 6.0` to `?? undefined`
- Fixed rating check in getCuratedFilteringParams from `!== null && !== undefined` to `> 0`
- Consistent behavior: 0 means "no filter" not "use default"

**Network Browsing Infinite Scroll Pagination**
- **Backend Fix:** getNetworkAll now uses `page` parameter instead of hardcoded `page: 1`
- **Frontend Fix:** Changed isReachingEnd logic from checking `totalResults < 41` to `size >= totalPages`
- **Result:** Full Netflix catalog loads with infinite scroll instead of stopping at ~80 items

#### 📝 Technical Details

**Files Changed:**
- `server/routes/person.ts` - Import and use createTmdbWithRegionLanguage (lines 10, 15, 37)
- `server/routes/collection.ts` - Import and use createTmdbWithRegionLanguage (lines 6, 11)
- `server/routes/discover.ts` - Change curated defaults from 3000/6.0 to undefined (lines 52-53)
- `server/api/themoviedb/index.ts` - Add TV-style rating mappings (lines 403-417), fix pagination (lines 1813, 1822), fix rating check (line 438), conditional skipCuratedFilters (line 1813)
- `src/hooks/useDiscover.ts` - Fix isReachingEnd pagination logic (line 111)
- `package.json` - Bump version to 1.5.7

**Commits:**
- 737f31e: Initial Person/Collection/Network/Curated fixes
- 04119ae: Fix curated rating 0 check (> 0 instead of !== null)
- 61884ac: Fix getNetworkAll pagination (use page parameter)
- 0f76841: Fix frontend pagination (totalPages not totalResults)
- b690942: Fix network curated filters (conditional based on settings)
- 4de7280: Add TV-style rating mappings (TV-Y through TV-MA)

#### ⚡ Upgrade Instructions

## [1.5.6] - 2025-10-04

### 🔧 **Critical Bug Fix - Self-Healing Migration System**

#### 🛡️ Migration State Mismatch Fix
**Issue:** Users migrating from vanilla Overseerr could not log in even after upgrading to v1.5.5, with error:
```
SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: User_settings.maxMovieRating
```

**Root Cause:**
- TypeORM migration table marked migrations as "complete"
- Actual database columns were never created (failed/interrupted migration)
- User entity's `eager: true` on UserSettings caused automatic JOIN during authentication
- JOIN query failed on non-existent columns

**Solution - Self-Healing Migration Verification:**
- After TypeORM reports migrations complete, verify columns actually exist
- If verification fails, automatically re-run migrations to create missing columns
- Detailed logging of detection and repair process
- No manual database intervention required

#### ✅ What's Fixed
- **Automatic Migration Repair**: Detects and fixes migration state mismatches on startup
- **Enhanced Verification**: Checks all critical content filtering columns exist
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear logging and graceful failure handling
- **Zero User Intervention**: Simply upgrade and the system auto-repairs on startup

#### 📋 Technical Details
- Enhanced `server/index.ts` migration verification logic (lines 100-140)
- Verifies: `maxMovieRating`, `maxTvRating`, `tmdbSortingMode`, `curatedMinVotes`, `curatedMinRating`
- Uses `runMigrations({ transaction: 'all' })` to force re-execution when needed
- Logs detailed information about repair process

#### ⚡ Upgrade Instructions
**Docker Users (Recommended):**
```bash
docker pull larrikinau/overseerr-content-filtering:latest
docker-compose restart
```

**Expected Logs (If Auto-Fix Triggered):**
```
[warn][Database]: Content filtering columns missing - attempting to fix by re-running migrations
[info][Database]: Successfully re-ran 2 migrations to fix schema
[info][Database]: Content filtering columns now verified after migration fix
```

No manual migration needed - existing settings and database fully preserved!

## [1.5.5] - 2025-10-03

### 🔐 **Security & Architecture Enhancement**

#### 🛡️ API Security Hardening
**Global API Content Filtering:**
- **Enhanced content filtering** applied consistently across all routes
- **Previously**: Some discovery and search routes had incomplete filtering coverage
- **Now**: All TMDB API calls use certification-based filtering for comprehensive protection
- **Impact**: Users cannot access restricted content regardless of entry point
- **Behavior**: Restricted content is filtered at the TMDB API integration layer

#### 🔧 Architecture Improvements
**Comprehensive Route-Level Filtering:**
- Content filtering applied at TMDB API integration layer for consistent behavior
- Search, discovery, trending, and recommendation routes all use certification validation
- Server-side certification caching improves performance while maintaining security

#### 📋 Configuration Management
**Production Configuration Files:**
- Added `overseerr-api.yml` to repository (previously excluded in .gitignore)
- Resolved production deployment file availability issue

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed missing overseerr-api.yml file causing frontend 404s in production
- Resolved OpenAPI specification file availability during Docker deployment
- Ensured test environment properly isolated from production volumes

### 📦 Deployment Notes
- **Critical**: Requires `overseerr-api.yml` config file in deployment
- **Docker Volume**: Test environment uses separate volume from production
- **Database**: Compatible with v1.5.4 database schema (no migrations required)

### 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Health checks pass
- ✅ Database migrations verified
- ✅ Frontend routes respond correctly
- ✅ API content filtering validated
- ✅ Test environment isolated and functional

## [1.5.4] - 2025-10-02

### 🐛 **CRITICAL BUGFIXES - Content Discovery Issues**

#### 🔧 Fixed Issues

**Issue #1 - Upcoming Movies and TV Shows Not Displaying:**
- **🎬 Frontend Routing Fix**: Fixed slider routing to use dedicated `/discover/movies/upcoming` and `/discover/tv/upcoming` pages instead of generic discovery
- **📡 API Endpoint Correction**: Changed API calls from generic discovery endpoints to specialized upcoming endpoints
- **🎯 Conditional Backend Logic**: Users with no restrictions see all upcoming content via native TMDB endpoints; users with rating restrictions see appropriately filtered upcoming content
- **✨ Smart Filtering**: Curated filters (vote/rating thresholds) bypassed for upcoming content to ensure results display

**Issue #2 - Network Pages Only Showing TV Shows:**
- **🎥 Movie Discovery Fix**: Added `skipCuratedFilters: true` parameter to movie discovery in `getNetworkAll` method
- **📺 Balanced Content**: Network pages (Netflix, HBO, Apple TV+, etc.) now display both movies and TV shows as intended
- **🔍 Maintained Restrictions**: Content rating restrictions still apply while showing broader catalog

**Issue #13/#16 - NR (Not Rated) Content Filtering:**
- **✅ Already Working**: NR content filtering verified working in production since v1.5.2
- **🔒 Adult Flag Usage**: NR content properly filtered using TMDB's `adult` flag
- **🛡️ Comprehensive Coverage**: Applied across Trending, Recommendations, Similar, and Discovery pages

#### ❌ What Was Broken
- Upcoming Movies and Upcoming TV slider links navigated to generic discovery pages instead of dedicated upcoming pages
- Backend API calls were using discovery endpoints instead of upcoming-specific endpoints
- Network pages (like Netflix, HBO) only showed TV shows, completely omitting movies
- Movies on network pages were being filtered out by overly aggressive curated filtering logic

#### ✅ What's Fixed
- Upcoming content pages now display correctly for all user permission levels
- Users without restrictions see full upcoming catalogs via native TMDB endpoints
- Users with rating restrictions see appropriately filtered upcoming content
- Network pages now show mixed content (both movies and TV shows) as designed
- Content rating restrictions still apply appropriately across all pages
- NR content filtering continues to work as implemented in v1.5.2

#### 📝 Technical Details
- Updated `src/components/Discover/index.tsx` (lines 244-253, 271-280) to fix slider routing and API endpoints
- Updated `server/api/themoviedb/index.ts` (line ~1826) to add `skipCuratedFilters: true` for network movie discovery
- No database migrations required - fully compatible with existing v1.5.2+ databases
- Thoroughly tested in isolated development environment with production database copy
- All three major issues verified as resolved with no regressions detected

#### ⚡ Upgrade Instructions

**Simple Docker Update:**
```bash
docker pull larrikinau/overseerr-content-filtering:1.5.4
# or
docker pull larrikinau/overseerr-content-filtering:latest
docker restart overseerr-content-filtering
```

No manual migration needed - existing settings and database fully preserved!

## [1.5.3] - 2025-10-02

### 🐛 **CRITICAL BUGFIX - NR (Not Rated) Content Filtering**

#### 🔧 Fixed Issue

**Issue #16 - NR Content Showing for Restricted Users:**
- **🎬 NR Content Filtering**: Fixed bug where users with content rating restrictions (G/PG/PG-13/R/TV-Y through TV-14) were seeing NR (Not Rated) content
- **🔒 Parental Control Safety**: Restored proper filtering for unrated content when restrictions are enabled
- **🎯 Intelligent NR Handling**: Added smart logic to distinguish between safe NR content (documentaries, indie films) and adult NR content (porn)

#### ❌ What Was Broken
- Users with PG/TV-G restrictions saw NR (Not Rated) movies and TV shows on Popular Movies/TV pages
- The filtering code checked if certification exists, but "NR" is a valid string value, so it passed the check
- This was a parental control safety issue - children could be exposed to inappropriate unrated content

#### ✅ What's Fixed
- **For G/PG/PG-13/R movie restrictions**: ALL NR content is now blocked (safe default for families)
- **For "Adult" movie restriction**: NR content is checked against TMDB's `adult` flag:
  - Non-adult NR content (documentaries, indie films, foreign films) → Allowed
  - Adult NR content (porn) → Blocked
- **For ALL TV rating restrictions** (TV-Y through TV-MA): ALL NR content is blocked
  - TMDB does not provide an `adult` flag for TV shows (only movies have this)
  - Cannot reliably distinguish safe NR TV from adult NR TV
  - Safe approach: block all NR content when any TV restriction is set
- **For unrestricted users**: All NR content shown (no filtering applied)

#### 🆕 Additional Improvements
- **Updated TV Rating Default**: Set default TV rating to `"TV-MA"` (blocks NR/unrated content)
  - Safer default for new users - blocks potentially adult unrated TV content
  - Allows all rated TV content (TV-Y through TV-MA)
  - Users can still change to `null` (unrestricted) if they want to see NR content
- **Clarified TV-MA Label**: Updated frontend label to "TV-MA - Allow TV-MA and below (blocks NR/unrated content)"
  - Makes it clear that TV-MA blocks all unrated content
  - Reflects the fact that TMDB doesn't provide adult flags for TV shows

#### 📝 Technical Details
- Updated `filterUnratedMovies()` in `server/api/themoviedb/index.ts` to handle NR based on restriction type
  - For "Adult" restriction: Uses TMDB's `adult` flag to distinguish adult from non-adult NR
  - For G/PG/PG-13/R: Blocks ALL NR content
- Updated `filterUnratedTv()` in `server/api/themoviedb/index.ts` to block ALL NR content
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation error from attempting to use non-existent `adult` field on TV shows
  - TMDB's `TmdbTvDetails` interface does not include `adult` field (only movies have this)
- Changed default for `maxTvRating` in `server/entity/UserSettings.ts` to `"TV-MA"`
- Updated TV-MA label in `src/components/UserProfile/UserSettings/UserGeneralSettings/index.tsx`
- No additional API calls required - uses existing TMDB data

#### ⚡ Upgrade Instructions

**Simple Docker Update:**
```bash
docker pull larrikinau/overseerr-content-filtering:1.5.3
# or
docker pull larrikinau/overseerr-content-filtering:latest
docker restart overseerr-content-filtering
```

- **🎯 Movie Recommendations**: Fixed `/movie/:id/recommendations` endpoint to apply content rating filters
- **📺 TV Recommendations**: Fixed `/tv/:id/recommendations` endpoint to respect user TV rating limits
- **🔄 Similar Movies**: Fixed `/movie/:id/similar` endpoint to honor user rating restrictions
- **🔄 Similar TV Shows**: Fixed `/tv/:id/similar` endpoint to apply content filtering

**Curated Filter Issue with Upcoming Content:**
- **📅 Upcoming Movies**: Fixed empty results when curated discovery mode enabled for upcoming movies
- **📅 Upcoming TV Shows**: Fixed empty results when curated discovery mode enabled for upcoming TV shows
- **Root Cause**: Upcoming content in TMDb often has zero votes/ratings, causing curated filters to exclude all results
- **Solution**: Skip curated quality filters (vote count/rating thresholds) for upcoming content while maintaining content rating restrictions

#### ❌ What Was Broken
- Trending section showed unfiltered content regardless of user rating restrictions
- Movie and TV recommendations displayed content above user's rating limits
- Similar content suggestions bypassed content filtering
- Upcoming movies/TV shows returned empty results when curated discovery mode was enabled
- Users with content restrictions saw inappropriate content in trending and recommendation sections

#### ✅ What's Fixed
- All trending, recommendation, and similar content endpoints now properly apply content rating filters
- Upcoming content endpoints intelligently skip curated filters while maintaining rating restrictions
- 100% content filtering coverage across all discovery, trending, and recommendation features
- Curated discovery mode works correctly for both current and upcoming content

#### 📝 Technical Details
- Updated `getAllTrending()` in `server/api/themoviedb/index.ts` to apply content rating filters
- Updated `getMovieRecommendations()` and `getTvRecommendations()` to respect user rating limits
- Updated `getSimilarMovies()` and `getSimilarTvShows()` to apply content filtering
- Modified `/movies/upcoming` endpoint in `server/routes/discover.ts` to conditionally use discover vs native upcoming API
- Added `skipCuratedFilters` flag for `/tv/upcoming` endpoint to bypass vote/rating thresholds
- Enhanced logic to distinguish between real content restrictions and adult-only blocking
- Removed debug console.log statements from `server/routes/search.ts`

#### ⚡ Upgrade Instructions

**Simple Docker Update:**
```bash
docker pull larrikinau/overseerr-content-filtering:1.5.2
# or
docker pull larrikinau/overseerr-content-filtering:latest
docker restart overseerr-content-filtering
```

### 🐛 **BUGFIX - All Trending Content Filtering**

#### 🔧 Fixed
- **🎬 All Trending Filtering**: Fixed `/discover/trending` endpoint ("Trending" section on homepage) to properly filter mixed content (movies + TV shows)
- **🔍 Mixed Content Post-Processing**: Added intelligent post-filtering for `/trending/all/` TMDb API endpoint which doesn't support certification parameters
- **📺 Comprehensive Coverage**: Trending section now respects both movie rating filters AND TV rating filters for mixed results

#### ❌ What Was Broken
- The "Trending" section on homepage showed unfiltered content regardless of user rating restrictions
- TMDb's `/trending/all/` API endpoint doesn't accept certification filtering parameters
- Mixed content (movies + TV + people) wasn't being filtered server-side after API response

#### ✅ What's Fixed
- Trending section now applies post-filtering based on media_type:
  - Movies: Filtered through content rating and unrated removal when restrictions enabled
  - TV Shows: Filtered through TV rating and unrated removal when restrictions enabled  
  - People/Collections: Passed through without filtering (not media content)
- 100% content filtering coverage across entire Discovery page including Trending

#### 📝 Technical Details
- Updated `getAllTrending()` method in `server/api/themoviedb/index.ts`
- Removed non-functional certification parameters from `/trending/all/` API calls
- Added intelligent media_type-based post-processing using existing `filterUnratedMovies()` and `filterUnratedTv()` methods

### 🔧 **Build Improvements**

#### 🚀 Default Local Build Tag
- **Set `COMMIT_TAG=local` as default** in Dockerfile
- Prevents update notification loops when building locally
- Production builds can still override with actual version tags
- Improves developer and self-hosted user experience

### 📖 **Documentation Overhaul**

#### Simplified Documentation
